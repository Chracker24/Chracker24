# Welcome to my side of Github 😄
I am a [B.Eng Software Engineering student](https://www.qub.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/software-engineering-placement-beng-g604/) at Queen's University Belfast with a passion in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Product Innovation** and **International Relations**.(Wild combo, i know 👀) Here i create Repositories to store code and files of the projects that I love and loved coding.
When I’m not coding, you’ll catch me:
- Writing stories ✍️
- Drafting scripts for stand-up comedy 🎤
- And overthinking geopolitical strategies like a politician before an election.
